The files herein contained are gathered for purposes of ease on running the code. For ANY modification on them, please be mindful of the code structure.

Each price structure assigns a quadratic cost to the generator, a linear cost (connection or generation), and houses' time-of-use and feed-in-tarrifs (fixed at 10c/kWh directly inside the code - change as needed). 

A fixed generation cost c0 is shown, but not used inside the code.


Units are [$/kWh].


Do not rename the files or move them, without first changing the code as necessary.
